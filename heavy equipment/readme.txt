    excavator
    dump_truck
    concrete_mixer_truck

2. STRUCTURE
there are two folders and one json file in this zip:
    ACID_Images contains 2850 construction images in jpg format.
    ACID_Annotations contains annotation of images in VOC format.
    ACID.json is the COCO format of annotations.
You may use ACID_Images and ACID_Annotations if your detector requires VOC format input.
You may use ACID_Images and ACID.json if your detector requires COCO format input.
